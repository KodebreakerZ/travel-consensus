    Just these two variables allow us to dynamically update
    our app. Every couple of seconds, the app asks the database
    for the tasks, messages, and suggestions for the task and trip
    we are looking at. We then pass those lists of data to the
    React components we build. They each detect new data has been
    passed, virtually build a new component, then only if there has
    been a change will it actually change the app view.

    That's pretty much the crux of the app updating.
